# DataScience

steps to develop an predictive model

1. Domain exploration
    - understand the business process
    - understand the sources of data, business beliefs and common challenges
    
    
2. Data Collection and Data Exploration
    - collect data from multiple units of business, build a dataset
    - perform a generic exploration of data
    
    
3. Data Cleaning
    - handle duplicate entries
    - handle unwanted columns
    - handle missing values
    - handle outliers
    
    
4. Feature Engineering
    - Feautre Extraction
    - Feature Selection
        - Data Visualization
        - Statistical methods


5. Preprocessing
    - Encoding, scaling
    - train test split


6.  Apply ML - train an ML algorithm to build a model
    - pick an appropriate algorithm
    - train the model


7. Performance Analysis
    - choose an appropriate metrics to assess performance


8. Optmization and Tuning
    - perform better feature engineering
    - adding more data points / features
    - trying more powerfull algorithm


9. Deployment to production
10. Monitor the performance in production# DataScience
